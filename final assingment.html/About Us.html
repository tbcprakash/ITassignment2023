      <h2>Manju THakulla</h2>
      <h2>Surendra K.C</h2>
      <p>Sourcing Materials: This involves identifying and selecting the materials needed to create the designed products. These materials 
        could include fabrics, trims, embellishments, hardware, and other components. The team scouts for suppliers, evaluates samples, negotiates
         pricing and terms, and ensures that the selected materials meet quality and sustainability standards.
  
        Costing and Budgeting: Product developers work to determine the cost of materials and manufacturing processes 
        involved in bringing a design to life. They calculate the total cost per unit and work within budget constraints 
        set by the brand or company.
        
        Prototyping and Sampling: Once materials are sourced, the Product Development Team creates prototypes or samples of the designs.
         These prototypes serve as physical representations of the designer's vision and are used for testing fit, construction, and overall 
         feasibility. The team may iterate on prototypes multiple times based on feedback from designers, fit models, and other stakeholders.
        
        Quality Control: Ensuring the quality and integrity of the products is a top priority for the Product Development Team. They establish
         quality standards and specifications for materials and manufacturing processes, conduct inspections at various stages of production, and 
         address any issues or defects that arise. This includes testing for colorfastness, durability, shrinkage, and other performance metrics.
        
        Technical Design: Product developers work closely with technical designers to translate design sketches into detailed technical specifications 
        or tech packs. These documents outline measurements, construction details, stitching techniques, and other technical aspects necessary for
         production. Technical designers collaborate with pattern makers and sample makers to ensure that the design's integrity is maintained throughout the production process.
        
        Collaboration with Manufacturing Partners: The Product Development Team liaises with manufacturing partners, whether in-house or external 
        factories, to oversee the production process. They communicate technical specifications, resolve production challenges, and ensure that the 
        final products meet the brand's standards and timeline requirements.</p>
